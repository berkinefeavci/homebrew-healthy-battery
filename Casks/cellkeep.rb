  caveats <<~EOS
    Upgrades keep Cellkeep's helpers. To remove them, use Settings → General → Uninstall
    Cellkeep first, or `brew uninstall --zap --cask cellkeep`.
    Cellkeep's charge limit uses macOS's own charge-limit setting, which stays as it was
    after uninstalling. Reset it in System Settings → Battery if you want to.
